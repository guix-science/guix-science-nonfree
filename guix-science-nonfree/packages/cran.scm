     "This package provides several cubic spline interpolation methods of H.
Akima for irregular and regular gridded data are available through this
package, both for the bivariate case and univariate case.  Linear
interpolation of irregular gridded data is also covered.  A bilinear
interpolator for regular grids was also added for comparison with the bicubic
interpolator on regular grids.")

capabilities provide end-to-end automation for large-scale simulation
pipelines, and they enhance computational reproducibility.")
