     "Unified Communication X (UCX) provides an optimized communication layer
for message passing (MPI), portable global address space (PGAS) languages and
run-time support libraries, as well as RPC and data-centric applications.

UCX utilizes high-speed networks for inter-node communication, and shared
memory mechanisms for efficient intra-node communication.

This package adds CUDA support for NVIDIA GPUs.")))
